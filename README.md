# FittingAModel2023
Repository for PSI Numerical Method 2023 lesson on "Fitting a model to data"

This lesson uses some ideas from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686
and Table 1 from that paper has been copied into `data.csv`.


For more info:
The file with name Project 1 is the file of the Project, the Untitled is a copy (to be sure I wouldn't delete something and lose the code, I also inclide Dustin's LICENSE because I think without it I cannot read the data, or I'm doing something wrong.)
